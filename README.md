# FleetManagement
DEVELOP &amp; DEPLOY A FLEET MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD WITH ETISALAT IOT  [3 Nov 2020, 5PM UAE Time]  Fleet Management is an important IoT use case for smart mobility that coalesces data from various sources and produces a high level analytical view.  

In this session, we’ll build on our introduction (https://www.theassembly.ae/videos/build-a-fleet-management-system-part-i/) last week and show you how to rapidly develop and deploy a rich web dashboard for our system which includes:  
1. Global map and data views for all vehicles 
2. Tabbed views with drill down charts, route/warning history &amp; gauges for individual vehicles 
3. High level analytics with information change history 
4. Admin dispatch commands from the interface app 
5. Geofencing  

We’ll also create a data simulator in the platform to mimic our edge devices and further refine our data inheritance model to accommodate a variety of vehicle types.
